Everything was lost!\r\nHey, I have been more mature till the day I wrote my last poem in that diary\r\nThere used to be my separate world of creation, my prince and the beautiful fairy.\r\n\r\nThere were high mountains that could touch the sky, huge lakes around my dream home, and colors of my imagination\r\nI never needed the bigger reason to smile, even if I could water the plants that day, it would be the time of celebration.\r\n\r\nHey, I have been more mature till the day I wrote my last poem in that diary\r\nThere used to be my separate world of creation, my prince and the beautiful fairy.\r\n\r\nThere were high mountains that could touch the sky, huge lakes around my dream home, and colors of my imagination I never needed the bigger reason to smile, even if I could water the plants that day, it would be the time of celebration.\r\n\r\nIn those days, I was small even though my realizations were so obvious and unbelievably wonderful\r\nI had always thought to make this world the best place to live and every human here would be kind and soulful.\r\n\r\nI was taken by the surprise when I woke up just to see the world totally different from my assumption\r\nHere is no love, affection, people live here to satisfy themselves and this world is a total destruction.\r\n\r\nThis is the world where people die and mainly the reason is hunger, murder or suicide\r\nMy heaven turned to this awful hell. I am already broken and destroyed somewhere inside.\r\n\r\nSometimes, many questions make my life more difficult to live and survive\r\nEven though my hope was murdered, my dreams were snatched, I am still alive!\r\n\r\nHere are many children who have never felt the warmness of their mother’s lap\r\nAnd look at me,how can I live without changing this world? Seriously, I had been handicapped.\r\n\r\nO god, provide me some power. I will make my dream world, an alluring reality\r\nI will enlighten everyone’s soul by your power or changing their mentality.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up, everything was lost; those mountains, my home surrounded by lakes, and the heart I felt within all humans\r\nHowever it is how life is, we have to live, learn, fall, rise, love, hate, criticize, accept because life is not a fiction.\r\n\r\n[To be a girl](http://dwitnews.com/day-regretted-girl/)![Girl](http://dwitnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pizap.com14142498413021.jpg)## That Day… She Regretted Being a Girl\r\n\r\nShe had a dream. She loved to smile. She seemed so happy, but until that day. That day, her dreams went off track. She was raped. She could not go anywhere because she was raped. She had to face terrible questions. She could not smile because the reason of her smile was lost somewhere. How can she now think about living a free life? How can that girl be happy again? She still hasn’t been given justice. Why? People think, “Maybe, she was never raped. She may be trying to get attention. Why should anyone believe her?” Doctors are taught that raped victims may accuse them for raping so they have to be aware of such girls. Arghhh… Oh! Society and doctors, enough is enough!\r\n\r\nI was just watching the episode “Fighting Rape” of Satyamev Jayate on YouTube.  It was about rape victims. I was shocked to know the dark beliefs of society, government, and police and so called life saviors – doctors. This show was talking about India but this story may be the realities of many girls in developing and developed countries like Nepal, Pakistan, India and so on. If a girl is raped, she becomes a victim. Her body is tortured, she becomes impure. Her life is shattered, she is now aimless. Somebody’s son or your husband raped a girl or woman. Now, the spine-chilling story begins. Her life is ruined. Her smile is lost. But, what about your son or husband? Is your husband still living with you and your family after destroying her life? You forgave him, why? Just because he is your son or your darling husband? What about that girl? He has killed her emotions, trust and hope.

It sounds funny, doesn’t it? Have patience guys, you will surely gain something from this article. I may seem juvenile and crazy all the time, but somewhere inside me, there lies a sensible girl. No..no wait.. I find the word “sensible” quite grotesque. Better call me childish and ludicrous. Creative writing, what shoud I write on? I was thinking on this when suddenly something gave a knocking call on my mind. Why not write on something that I live on and learn from? When I shared this idea with my friend, Asmita. She said, “How do these boring ideas flicker on your mind?” Now that’s really rude, fuchie (the tiny one, haha). Never forget that ideas are neither boring nor interesting. Every idea has a value on its own. Even the ideas that we assume to be lackluster can win the hearts of millions. Anyways, “nature” is not a boring topic to be discussed about; it’s an amazing reality of our life.[Read more](http://dwitnews.com/see-god-lap-nature/)\r\n\r\nIf you want to read my articles then go to:\r\nhttp://dwitnews.com/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
