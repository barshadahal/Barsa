Everything was lost!\r\nHey, I have been more mature till the day I wrote my last poem in that diary\r\nThere used to be my separate world of creation, my prince and the beautiful fairy.\r\n\r\nThere were high mountains that could touch the sky, huge lakes around my dream home, and colors of my imagination\r\nI never needed the bigger reason to smile, even if I could water the plants that day, it would be the time of celebration.\r\n\r\nHey, I have been more mature till the day I wrote my last poem in that diary\r\nThere used to be my separate world of creation, my prince and the beautiful fairy.\r\n\r\nThere were high mountains that could touch the sky, huge lakes around my dream home, and colors of my imagination I never needed the bigger reason to smile, even if I could water the plants that day, it would be the time of celebration.\r\n\r\nIn those days, I was small even though my realizations were so obvious and unbelievably wonderful\r\nI had always thought to make this world the best place to live and every human here would be kind and soulful.\r\n\r\nI was taken by the surprise when I woke up just to see the world totally different from my assumption\r\nHere is no love, affection, people live here to satisfy themselves and this world is a total destruction.\r\n\r\nThis is the world where people die and mainly the reason is hunger, murder or suicide\r\nMy heaven turned to this awful hell. I am already broken and destroyed somewhere inside.\r\n\r\nSometimes, many questions make my life more difficult to live and survive\r\nEven though my hope was murdered, my dreams were snatched, I am still alive!\r\n\r\nHere are many children who have never felt the warmness of their mother’s lap\r\nAnd look at me,how can I live without changing this world? Seriously, I had been handicapped.\r\n\r\nO god, provide me some power. I will make my dream world, an alluring reality\r\nI will enlighten everyone’s soul by your power or changing their mentality.\r\n\r\nWhen I woke up, everything was lost; those mountains, my home surrounded by lakes, and the heart I felt within all humans\r\nHowever it is how life is, we have to live, learn, fall, rise, love, hate, criticize, accept because life is not a fiction.\r\n\r\n[To be a girl](http://dwitnews.com/day-regretted-girl/)![Girl](http://dwitnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pizap.com14142498413021.jpg)## That Day… She Regretted Being a Girl\r\n\r\nShe had a dream. She loved to smile. She seemed so happy, but until that day. That day, her dreams went off track. She was raped. She could not go anywhere because she was raped. She had to face terrible questions. She could not smile because the reason of her smile was lost somewhere. How can she now think about living a free life? How can that girl be happy again? She still hasn’t been given justice. Why? People think, “Maybe, she was never raped. She may be trying to get attention. Why should anyone believe her?” Doctors are taught that raped victims may accuse them for raping so they have to be aware of such girls. Arghhh… Oh! Society and doctors, enough is enough!\r\n\r\nI was just watching the episode “Fighting Rape” of Satyamev Jayate on YouTube.  It was about rape victims. I was shocked to know the dark beliefs of society, government, and police and so called life saviors – doctors. This show was talking about India but this story may be the realities of many girls in developing and developed countries like Nepal, Pakistan, India and so on. If a girl is raped, she becomes a victim. Her body is tortured, she becomes impure. Her life is shattered, she is now aimless. Somebody’s son or your husband raped a girl or woman. Now, the spine-chilling story begins. Her life is ruined. Her smile is lost. But, what about your son or husband? Is your husband still living with you and your family after destroying her life? You forgave him, why? Just because he is your son or your darling husband? What about that girl? He has killed her emotions, trust and hope.\r\n\r\nFinally, this great society wants to help that girl but by the words of sympathy. If that girl tries to fight back then these types of questions are asked by police, “Oh! Then you were raped? What did he do exactly? Where did he touch you? Did it hurt?” It’s really demeaning, her soul is already smashed, now what do you want? Do you want to wreck her down as those criminals had done? Hey government, you call this justice? She will never trust the system of her country again. A girl is raped and she wants to fight for herself but these kinds of questions will torture and rape her time and again. You may not know there are some women who were raped 20 years ago but still their criminals are somewhere uncaught, living their life happily. Unbelievable! Some wild animals came in their life and scotched their happiness but they are living their life without any remorse and shame. How can anyone tolerate this?\r\n\r\nWas that her fault to be a girl? Was that her mistake to go to school that day? Was that her sin to return back home after office? Was that her flaw even to get noticed by those savage inhuman creatures? I was traumatized when I heard that even in hospitals, raped victims are treated in the worst way. Victim is crying loud with pain. Then, doctors come in front of her and begin to study her body. Senior doctors tell their juniors, “Look! This is how raped patients should be treated. Don’t give her painkillers. At first, study her body. Is she bleeding? Can you see some scratches in her body?” Now tell me, won’t that girl take those doctors as the next criminals who are going to rape her body again in the name of experimentation? What the hell is happening on this planet? Sometimes I ask myself where I am. I am a girl. Should I be proud or should I ask my parents why they gave birth to a girl? Why do these types of crimes happen in our country, our world? How can we sleep every night like we are in heaven? Those screams, those cries, those heart rending stories are the truth of our world but we are relaxing as if nothing has happened. Our sisters are getting raped and we are silent. Whom are we waiting for, government, police, society? Don’t be stupid; they will again ignore those stories as they’ve been always doing so.\r\n\r\nMany girls killed themselves because they felt somewhere that it was their fault. This society compelled them to believe that. If a girl is raped, society says to her, “Your virginity is lost. You’re now impure. Who will marry you?” Oh lord! How can this society be so cruel? Why can’t people understand, a girl is not the one to be blamed. When they need moral and emotional support, everyone questions them. Even if she wants to live, she has to hide her identity. She has to hide that she was raped, but why? Somebody raped her, that person should be ashamed of himself not the girl. If I am raped then I am not the perpetrator the rapist is. If law cannot give me justice and if that person is still living freely then I will snatch his life. I should have the right to kill him. If I shoot him, will I be a criminal? I don’t think so. He was a criminal, society was wrong and the law itself played a role of villain. I was innocent.\r\n\r\nAfter watching that show, I couldn’t control my tears. I am living in this kind of world and still I have no guts to change it. Today I may be the only person but tomorrow others will feel the way I am feeling. They have to if they are humans. But still why am I not able to take any steps? I was constantly asking this to myself. And finally I heard a voice inside me. One day I will. Even if I cannot change the world, I will at least light a single bright candle of hope that will one day lighten million candles. I will tell them, “Even if you are raped, let it go. That person lost the chance to be human anymore but you haven’t lost anything. Never forget, you are not the one to be blamed. You are the one to be trusted, loved and respected. Your body was touched not your soul. You were, are and will be pure forever. Those pieces of shit cannot destroy you. Fight for your justice and always stay happy. Yeah.. Life is beautiful! :)”\r\n\r\n[Nature](http://dwitnews.com/see-god-lap-nature/)![Nature-God](http://dwitnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nature.jpg)### I See God in Your Lap, Nature\r\n\r\nNow this 19 year old girl will talk about the lessons she has learnt from nature. It sounds funny, doesn’t it? Have patience guys, you will surely gain something from this article. I may seem juvenile and crazy all the time, but somewhere inside me, there lies a sensible girl. No..no wait.. I find the word “sensible” quite grotesque. Better call me childish and ludicrous. Creative writing, what shoud I write on? I was thinking on this when suddenly something gave a knocking call on my mind. Why not write on something that I live on and learn from? When I shared this idea with my friend, Asmita. She said, “How do these boring ideas flicker on your mind?” Now that’s really rude, fuchie (the tiny one, haha). Never forget that ideas are neither boring nor interesting. Every idea has a value on its own. Even the ideas that we assume to be lackluster can win the hearts of millions. Anyways, “nature” is not a boring topic to be discussed about; it’s an amazing reality of our life.\r\n\r\nYou will know me better after reading this. I love to get wet in the rain. If people won’t stare at me, I will  go dance in the rain every time. Hahahaha… How can anybody hate rainy season? When dark clouds cover the sky, rainfall is necessary just to make the sky bluer and clearer again. I can feel the pain of hot tears rolling down my cheek, but still the relief I get after crying is something more than that pain. It clears my confusion like the rain clears the dark sky. Have you ever seen river stock-still? No.. Just think how sincerely it flows in its own way and reaches its destination. River never gets distracted by anything. Then why cannot we concentrate on our aim like a river does? We always try to escape from our responsibilities. How free are those birds. They never worry about their life and death. Plants and Flowers keep smiling for us in every situation. They are also living beings, but what keeps them alive and fresh every time? I believe there lies some supernatural power behind it. What do you think? Why do we humans worry too much? Like their, our life will also go on. If you can change something just do it if not, then it isn’t something of your concern. Let it be. Don’t worry too much! Whenever I feel low, I go up and continuously look at those hills. What is keeping them motionless for thousand years? Have you ever thought in that way? I always do. Something I learn from them is never change yourself, although situation gets worst. I am the truth of my life. If I will change, then who will be living my life? Sometimes I feel like I am changing. I meet the negative side within me and it becomes so hard to ignore it. But my nature always drags me back.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and my favorite natural phenomena is sunset. From my home and my college, Deerwalk, it seems so mesmerizing. The scene of sunset always kisses my eyes and enlightens my soul. Awwwww…I wonder, how can something be so prepossessing? I want to shower words of respect upon the ones who have said, “Every sunset brings new sun shine or a new morning.” This part really inspires me. I am not trying to say that I never panic. I am the one who worries too much. Other people’s opinion about me doesn’t really matter to me. But when I realize I am not fulfilling my duties towards myself and towards my loved ones then it kills me inside. I am careless regarding many things. That makes me sad. But my lessons and my beliefs do not let me feel down for a longer time. I know very well. Nothing comes with guarentee in our life. Ups and downs are like the sunset. It is the inseparable part of life. Everyone has to live it.\r\n\r\nOne of my brothers had asked me, “Were you seriously smiling at the moon and trying to talk with the stars? Seriously, you are crazy!!” Then I immediately said to him, “So, you will never learn to be happy without any reason. I would prefer to live my life being crazy and a buoyant human rather than an unstable and so-called mature person.” He will never see the beauty of the moon and can never hear the whispers of the twinkling stars.\r\n\r\nI have not seen God. But I have always felt his presence in the eyes of my parents, in the lap of nature and in my own inner voice that every time tells something to me. Life is so beautiful if we find some place where we can spend our whole life without feeling alone. I love loneliness because when I am lonely I can stay at my favorite place and talk with the birds, raindrops, stars, moon , hills and plants. I feel like plants dance with the rhythm of my songs.\r\n\r\nI want to ask a favor with nature which is everything to me. Never let me change. Specially never make me villian of other’s life. I want to be chief of my mind and king of my own world. Whenever I feel low, teach me to wake up and bring new sunshine in my life. Whenever I feel like I am kept in a prison of duties then let me hear the voice of those birds which will always say me freedom is not the situation, it is the state of my own mind. Whenever I cry hard, let the sky cry so that my tears will get washed away by the rain drops. I do not want to forget that everything happens for a reason and our life will go on, and happiness is our choice not a situation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to read my articles then go to:\r\nhttp://dwitnews.com/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
