        <p># My world:
Hello everyone, today I will take you to my own world. writing articles have been a part of my life. I love writing opinions and creative writings. I am a freedom lover. So, for me freedom while writing is something that inspires me to write. Please read my article in <a href="http://dwitnews.com/">Articles</a> and always feel free to leave comments. </p>

<p>I have been working as reporter for Dwit news. Few months ago we celebrated our 25th edition. I will show you some pictures of that celebration. </p>

<p>Read article about our celebration.</p>

<p>We, the joyous, hard-working and dedicated members of the DWIT News Team were excited and delighted about the idea of celebrating our 25th edition. (After all, we all deserved it, didn’t we?) The idea came true when we got an approval from our college and so, 13th September was the most awaited day for us all.<a href="http://dwitnews.com/wonderful-benchmark-celebrate-treat-25th-edition-dwit-news/">Read more</a></p>

<p>It seems interesting, isn't it? Hahahha...

<p><a href="http://dwitnews.com/woke-everything-lost/">Poem</a><img src="http://dwitnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/life-is-not-a-fairytale.jpg" alt="fairy"># When I woke up…. Everything was lost!
Hey, I have been more mature till the day I wrote my last poem in that diary
There used to be my separate world of creation, my prince and the beautiful fairy.</p>

<p>There were high mountains that could touch the sky, huge lakes around my dream home, and colors of my imagination
I never needed the bigger reason to smile, even if I could water the plants that day, it would be the time of celebration.</p>

<p>Hey, I have been more mature till the day I wrote my last poem in that diary
There used to be my separate world of creation, my prince and the beautiful fairy.</p>

<p>There were high mountains that could touch the sky, huge lakes around my dream home, and colors of my imagination I never needed the bigger reason to smile, even if I could water the plants that day, it would be the time of celebration.</p>

<p>In those days, I was small even though my realizations were so obvious and unbelievably wonderful
I had always thought to make this world the best place to live and every human here would be kind and soulful.</p>

<p>I was taken by the surprise when I woke up just to see the world totally different from my assumption
Here is no love, affection, people live here to satisfy themselves and this world is a total destruction.</p>

<p>This is the world where people die and mainly the reason is hunger, murder or suicide
My heaven turned to this awful hell. I am already broken and destroyed somewhere inside.</p>

<p>Sometimes, many questions make my life more difficult to live and survive
Even though my hope was murdered, my dreams were snatched, I am still alive!</p>

<p>Here are many children who have never felt the warmness of their mother’s lap
And look at me,how can I live without changing this world? Seriously, I had been handicapped.</p>

<p>O god, provide me some power. I will make my dream world, an alluring reality
I will enlighten everyone’s soul by your power or changing their mentality.</p>

<p>When I woke up, everything was lost; those mountains, my home surrounded by lakes, and the heart I felt within all humans
However it is how life is, we have to live, learn, fall, rise, love, hate, criticize, accept because life is not a fiction.</p>

<p>She had a dream. She loved to smile. She seemed so happy, but until that day. That day, her dreams went off track. She was raped. She could not go anywhere because she was raped. She had to face terrible questions. She could not smile because the reason of her smile was lost somewhere. How can she now think about living a free life? How can that girl be happy again? She still hasn’t been given justice. Why? People think, “Maybe, she was never raped. She may be trying to get attention. Why should anyone believe her?” Doctors are taught that raped victims may accuse them for raping so they have to be aware of such girls. Arghhh… Oh! Society and doctors, enough is enough<img src="http://dwitnews.com/day-regretted-girl/" alt="Read more"></p>

<p><a href="http://dwitnews.com/see-god-lap-nature/">Nature</a><img src="http://dwitnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/nature.jpg" alt="Nature-God">### I See God in Your Lap, Nature</p>

<p>Now this 19 year old girl will talk about the lessons she has learnt from nature. It sounds funny, doesn’t it? Have patience guys, you will surely gain something from this article. I may seem juvenile and crazy all the time, but somewhere inside me, there lies a sensible girl. No..no wait.. I find the word “sensible” quite grotesque. Better call me childish and ludicrous. Creative writing, what shoud I write on? I was thinking on this when suddenly something gave a knocking call on my mind. Why not write on something that I live on and learn from? When I shared this idea with my friend, Asmita. She said, “How do these boring ideas flicker on your mind?” Now that’s really rude, fuchie (the tiny one, haha). Never forget that ideas are neither boring nor interesting. Every idea has a value on its own. Even the ideas that we assume to be lackluster can win the hearts of millions. Anyways, “nature” is not a boring topic to be discussed about; it’s an amazing reality of our life.<a href="http://dwitnews.com/see-god-lap-nature/">Read more</a></p>
